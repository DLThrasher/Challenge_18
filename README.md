# Challenge_18


##In this project I created a blockchain-based ledger along with a web interface for users to interact with. After updated the code in the Python file I ran a steamlit webpage and tested its functionality. Everything ran as it should and I've included some two screenshots, one with a blockchain of 8 blocks and another that confirms the blockcahins validation. I've also included a third screenshot that shows an extended blockcahin with another confirmed validation.
